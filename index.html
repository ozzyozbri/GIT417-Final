                    <!--Product Display - This would be a section of your page that allows the user to view some of the available products or services this company offers one at a time, by clicking on a control that includes the product name. Each "product" must include a name, image, and short description (at least a sentence or two) that is displayed when chosen. One product will display by default on page load, and only one product should ever display on screen at a time. (Module 4 - Event Handling & The DOM) - Watch a video demonstrating a product displayLinks to an external site. MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE GAME PLAY ON YOUR SITE IF YOU CHOOSE THE PRODUCT DISPLAY FEATURE-->

                    <!--OR Cost Calculator - This would be a section of your page that displays a collection of top products, probably for "quick order" or something similar. Each product would include an image, price and name, and some control that the user can click on to add that product to their total. The total/tax/shipping will display in the "total" area of the section, and the total cost should display the current product total, tax and/or shipping, and total price with tax on change (every time the control for a product is clicked, the total should update). Include a button allowing the user to "check out" that when clicked will clear the cart, display the total cost of the items that were in the cart, and thank the user for their order. If the cart is empty when the user. clicks to checkout, they should see a message asking them to add something to the cart before they check out. (Module 4 - Event Handling & The DOM, Module 1 - Arithmetic,  Module 3 - Arrays) - Watch a video demonstrating the cost calculator/shopping cartLinks to an external site.-->

                    <!--Game Play - This section will most likely make sense as a sort of "contest" for the user. There will be an input where the user enters a number between 1 and 10. You will generate a random number that you display to the screen (with that the user guessed), and either declare them a winner (their guess matches the random number) or ask them to try again (their guess does not match the random number). You don't have to actually do anything when they "win" except say that they won. (Module 6 - Math Object, Module 4 - Event Handling & The DOM, Module 2 - Conditionals, possibly also M5 for validation) - Watch a video demonstrating the game playLinks to an external site.

                    email address

                    The name(s) and comments should be required, and the choice of how the user would like to be contacted should require either the phone or email (depending on what the user chose). The form should validate the required fields on submit (using regex, at least for the email and phone) and it should use the valid user info to create an object (customer) when the form is valid and submitted. Errors in the form should display to the user next to the input with the error and should be descriptive and noticeable. When the form is complete and submitted properly, the form should reset and display a message to the user thanking them for their submission, with the info they submitted, pulled from the object you created.-->
