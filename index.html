You will generate a random number that you display to the screen (with that the user guessed), and either declare them a winner (their guess matches the random number) or ask them to try again (their guess does not match the random number). You don't have to actually do anything when they "win" except say that they won.

                    email address

                    The name(s) and comments should be required, and the choice of how the user would like to be contacted should require either the phone or email (depending on what the user chose). The form should validate the required fields on submit (using regex, at least for the email and phone) and it should use the valid user info to create an object (customer) when the form is valid and submitted. Errors in the form should display to the user next to the input with the error and should be descriptive and noticeable. When the form is complete and submitted properly, the form should reset and display a message to the user thanking them for their submission, with the info they submitted, pulled from the object you created.-->
